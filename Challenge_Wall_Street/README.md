Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this analysis was to help our fictional friend calculate stocks for his parents. They had been heavily invested in "DQ" since they met at Dairy Queen. We went through many different tickers to find things like return and volume. During this time we built two seperate codes and measured their performance against one another for the same results. Though we received many "MsgBoxes" we never could determine which version of the code was faster and will need assitance in refactoring this project again. 

Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.

What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

There is a time savings to reusing code. It helps substitue in variables quicker and gives a basic outline of what the code should look like while looking for efficiencies along the way. 

One of the disadvatnages of refactoring code is that comments get in the way. The intentions on the first project could have changed over time and it is hard to rememeber why things may have been commented that way. Also, if you did not understand something the first time committing the code and were instructed to commit it, it is likely you still do not understand it fully yet on your refactored code. 

How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

These cons outweighed the pros in my experience since I could not get an output on my first attempt at the refactored code. I think things may have been easier if I just started from scratch with more resources and time at my disposal. ALso, there was only one lengthy example to choose from. Had there been two or more we could have done a greater comparison of the code.
