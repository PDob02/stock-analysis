Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this analysis was to help our fictional friend calculate stocks for his parents. They had been heavily invested in "DQ" since they met at Dairy Queen. We went through many different tickers to find things like return and volume. During this time we built two seperate codes and measured their performance against one another for the same results. 

Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.

What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
